## What is State Space Model
- State space modelling is a method to study evolution in stochastic process using internal state space variables.
- Let us considet the observable variable $y_{t}$ as

$$
y_{t} = Z_{t} S_{t} + \epsilon_{t}
$$

- where,
  -    $y_{t}$ is k dimensional vector,
  -    $Z_{t}$ is $k\times m$ dimesional obeservation vector coeffiecient matrix,
  -    $\epsilon_{t} \approx N(0,H_{t})$ is i.i.d with $H_{t}$ is $k\times k$ dimesional positive definite variance matrix.
- and state space equation at time $t$ be $y_{t}$ and $S_{t}$ respectively.
- We can express
